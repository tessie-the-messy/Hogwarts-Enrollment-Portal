# Sorting Hat

## Description

As passionate fans of the Harry Potter books and films, we chose to channel our motivation to develop a Hogwarts Enrollment Portal. In this modern day and age, we decided Hogwarts needed a technology upgrade beyond carrier owls delivering acceptance letters. Using our portal, Hogwarts students will be able to access their course schedule, House details, and personal registration information all in one place prior to the start of the school year and throughout the term.
